## Platform & Development Environment
- Framework: Arduino
- Development Environment: Arduino IDE
- Language: C

## Verification
The serialization logic was verified using a host-based C compiler
(Programiz Online Compiler). The Arduino example demonstrates how the same
logic would be integrated in an Arduino firmware to print the JSON output
to the Serial Monitor.
